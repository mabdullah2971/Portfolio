The dataset underwent cleaning and preprocessing before analysis. The data cleaning involved extensive code, so I separated the 
cleaning process into its own file. This allowed me to keep the analysis code clean and focused on the actual analysis 
without the data preparation details. The code files include the explanations behind the methods used to meet the stated objectives.
